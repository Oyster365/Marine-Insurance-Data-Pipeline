# Marine-Insurance-Data-Pipeline
I built a simple data pipeline where raw insurance policy, claim and customer data was made with Python as a CSV file, flows into PostgreSQL, is transformed with SQL, and a dashboard is made in Power BI. This pipeline replicates the process insurance product analysts use to monitor loss ratios, underwriting strategy, and annual profit.
